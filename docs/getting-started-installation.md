# Installation

## macOS

On macOS, NcURL can be installed via [https://brew.sh/](Homebrew) (recommended):

```console
$ brew tap ncurl/ncurl
$ brew install ncurl
```
## PyPI

A universal installation method (that works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, …, and always provides the latest version) is to use pip:

```shell
pip install -U ncurl
```
